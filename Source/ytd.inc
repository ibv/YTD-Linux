//-----Behavior/functionality--------------------------------------------------

{$DEFINE MULTIDOWNLOADS}
  // Allow multiple downloads per URL (needed for some downloaders)

{$DEFINE SYSTRAY}
  // Minimize to systray

{$ifdef linux}
{$DEFINE GETTEXT}
{$endif}
  // Multilanguage support

{$DEFINE THREADEDVERSION}
  // Check for new version done in an extra thread (in background)

{$DEFINE CONVERTERS}
  // Support for converters: applications called after a download is finished

{$DEFINE CONVERTERSMUSTBEACTIVATED}
  // Converters must be manually activated before they can be used. This option
  // is necessary because a vast majority of users didn't bother to read the
  // documentation and then complained that converters don't work.

{$DEFINE MINIMIZESIZE}
  // Minimize size of the application. For example, use fewer virtual methods
  // because each adds four (eight?) bytes to each descendant's size.

{$DEFINE SUBTITLES}
  // Global support for subtitles

{.DEFINE FASTMM}
  // Use the FastMM memory manager. By default it is only used in debug mode.

{$DEFINE DIRTYHACKS}
  // Allow providers which only work due to dirty hacks. The DEFINE also
  // marks parts of the code which should be rewritten if I only knew how.

{$DEFINE SHAREABLEFILES}
  // By default, the files being downloaded are opened in an exclusive mode
  // (because of some strange idea of Delphi that when a file is created,
  // share flags should not apply). This define provides a workaround, allowing
  // files being played while they are still downloading.

{$DEFINE GUI_LCL}
  // GUI is created with LCL, Linux 

{.$DEFINE GUI_WINAPI} 
  // GUI is created with WinAPI. Otherwise GUI is created with VCL. The WinAPI
  // GUI has several advantages, such as a double-buffered download list or
  // a compatibility with FreePascal, not mentioning a seriously reduced
  // executable size, but it is much more difficult to write (and understand, 
  // if the programmer has little or no experience with Windows API).

{$DEFINE DELPHITHREADS}
  // Use Delphi's implementation of TThread. This implementation seems to
  // be incompatible with WinAPI GUI under Delphi 2009, for an unknown reason,
  // so alternative implementations are used if this define is not set.
  // Note: The same is true for FPC.
  // What doesn't work:
  //   - Synchronize hangs until the application finishes. Obviously, since
  //     thread messages appear in TApiForm's message loop rather than 
  //     the TApplication's. "Fixed" by replacing Synchronize's with critical
  //     sections.
  //   - WaitFor fails with an error. No idea why.
  //   - OnTerminate doesn't get called. No idea why. So I call it manually.

{$DEFINE DIRECTDOWNLOADERS}
  // Publish direct downloaders for non-HTTP protocols (RTMP, MMS). Basically,
  // this allows YTD to work as a simplified RTMPDUMP/MSDL (without support
  // for extra parameters, only URL is supported).

{$DEFINE DOWNLOADTOTEMPFILES}
  // Use temporary files for downloads, then rename them when the download
  // is complete.

{DEFINE JSON}
  // Many providers use JSON for their data storage. While it may be a good idea
  // to use a JSON parser for this data, in fact it is often better to simply
  // use regular expressions: One, it is shorter, and two, it turns out LkJSON
  // has bugs which may prevent the parsing.

{.$DEFINE NONWORKING}
  // Build the non-working providers in. By default they are only available
  // in the debug mode.

{.$DEFINE SINGLEINSTANCE}
  // Support for running the GUI version as single instance. A new instance can
  // be spawned by using the --newinstance argument.

{$DEFINE SIMPLIFIEDHDSDOWNLOADER}
  // Use a simplified HDS downloader. It's the only one that works now :-)
  // It's heavily based on K-S-V's AdobeHDS.php
  // https://raw.github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/master/AdobeHDS.php
  // The most significant deficiencies are:
  // - Data packets are saved as they come. This requires that the Fragments are
  //   stored in the order of their playback and that they will have correct
  //   timestamps.
  // - No support for Live streaming. Since YTD is not meant to download live
  //   streams, it should be no big deal. Support for Live streaming requires
  //   the ability to refresh the manifest and continue with additional fragments.
  //   Also, it needs to deal with downloads being slower than the server's
  //   sending window.
  // - Resuming download requires the ability to parse the FLV file and match
  //   the latest timestamp in the file with an appropriate timestamp in the
  //   fragment list, deleting a part of the FLV file and starting download
  //   from a particular fragment.
  // - Multiple fragments downloaded at the same time. This is not planned.
